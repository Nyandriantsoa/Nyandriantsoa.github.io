The assignement took me 2 hours and half to complete it.
Today, I was learning how to install jstl and use it inside the JSPs.
It was not difficult but somehow tricky, as I got a lot of exception that I was just not able to understand. Then after reading more in the slides for this lab and searching on the internet, I was able to determine the problem.
The use of the custom tag and the jstl makes things a lot easier and remove all the scripting tags which provides the application one more layer of abstraction and help us to follow the Single Responsibility Principle.
