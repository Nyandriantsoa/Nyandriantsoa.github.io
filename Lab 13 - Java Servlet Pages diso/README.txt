The Lab was fun to make. It was pretty straight forward since a lot of tasks were already done by the files being given.
All that I had to do was to create the class Quiz which is reusable regardless of the type of the application whether it is a Web Application or a Command Line application.
I was able to combine the implementation of both ways in a single project.


I learned today that any application can be runned in different ways. If we use servlets, we can set up the tomcat server to run the application.
If we want to run as a Java command line application, we have to create a class with the main method and just run the project from that class.
